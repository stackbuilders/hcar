Octohat is a comprehensively test-covered Haskell library that wraps
GitHub's API. While we have used it successfully in an open-source
project to
\href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/openssh-github-keys}{automate
  granting access control to servers}, it is in very early
development, and it only covers a small portion of GitHub's API.

Octohat is available on
\href{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/octohat}{Hackage}, and
the source code can be found on
\href{https://github.com/stackbuilders/octohat}{GitHub}.

We have already received some contributions from the community for
Octohat, and we are looking forward to more contributions in the
future.
