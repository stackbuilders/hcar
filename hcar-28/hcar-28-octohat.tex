During the development of one of our internal projects we found the
need for a simple way to interact with GitHub's API. After finding the
existing solutions in Hackage hard to adapt to our needs, we began to
write our own API wrapper.

After two weeks of development, we released the first version of
Octohat. Currently we only cover a small part of the API, but we think
that the preliminary library design and Octohat's high level of
automated test coverage will make extension to cover more endpoints
easy. We are very responsive to pull requests and we are looking
forward to any contribution from the wider community.
