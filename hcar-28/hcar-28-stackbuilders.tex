  programming in Quito, Ecuador.

\item
  We maintain several packages in Hackage including hapistrano,
  inflections, octohat, openssh-github-keys, and twitter-feed.

\item
  We talk about Haskell at universities and events such as Lambda Days
  and BarCamp Rochester.

\item
  We write blog posts and tutorials about Haskell.

\end{itemize}
